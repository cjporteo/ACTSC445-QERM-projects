# Quantitative Enterprise Risk Management Projects

These projects were completed as course requirements for ACTSC445 (Quantitative Enterprise Risk Management) at University of Waterloo.

Grades for all of these projects were 98% or higher.

Various RM analysis techniques were conducted in R on real world stock data downloaded from [Yahoo Finance](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/). Each project is accompanied with a PowerPoint file to describe code output, visualizations, and conclusions.

These R scripts are flexible concerning new stock data; the included *.csv* files can be replaced with other data and the code will function after minimal revision. 

Snippets from the full analysis are included here.

## VaR Backtesting (AAPL)
